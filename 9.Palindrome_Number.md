Some hints:
Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)

If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.

You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?

There is a more generic way of solving this problem.

```ruby
# @param {Integer} x
# @return {Boolean}
def is_palindrome(x)
    return false if x < 0
    return false if x > 2147483647 or x <= -2147483648
    x = x.to_s
    (0..(x.length / 2)).each do |i|
        return false if x[i] != x[- (i + 1)]
    end
    true
end
