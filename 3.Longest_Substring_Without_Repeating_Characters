### Problem #3
[https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

```
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```
# @param {String} string
# @return {Integer}
def length_of_longest_substring(string)
    count = Array([0])
    puts 1 if string.length == 1
    i = 0
    while i <= string.length do
        if string[ i + 1 ] != nil
            if string[0..i].include? string[ i + 1 ]
              count.push string[0..i].length
              i -= string.slice!(0..string.index(string[ i + 1 ])).length
            end
        else
            count.push string[0..i].length
        end
        i += 1
    end
    return count.max
end
